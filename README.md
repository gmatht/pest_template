#A Sample Pest Application

This application is a sample parser using [pest](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest). It is based on the small example of a pest parser given in the pest README.md. You could just fork this application to have a template of pest application to develop from.

If you get compile errors, try using `rustc` version 1.31 beta.
